I'm a NYC based full stack Web Developer with experience in Rails, React, Redux, and JavaScript.
I began my journey by simply starting an online tutorial at CodeCademy out of curiosity and the desire to learn a new skill. This quickly blossomed into a full on obsession.
Sneaking in a few hours a day to code was not enough and I landed at an intense coding bootcamp - AppAcademy. From there I was able to work on amazing projects that challenged every part of me.
After losing many hours of sleep I finally here to begin the next journey - one using my curiosity and creativity to create amazing apps.
